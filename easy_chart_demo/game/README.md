# Easy Charts
A library of Charts plotted in Control, 2D and 3D nodes to visualize general purpose datasets.  
Author: *"Nicolo (fenix) Santilio"*  
Version: *0.5.7*  
Wiki: *[wip](https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts/wiki)*  
Godot Version: *3.2stable*   

## What is this?
*Easy Charts* is a collection of Control, 2D and 3D nodes to plot charts.   
This plugin was born from the personal necessity to plot some charts and tables for my university degree project.   
Here's an example:    ![]()   
Charts are really useful when it comes to visually represent values in a powerful and more understandable way, mostly when these charts also have visually pleasing features.   
If you need to plot a chart with some values in it and just take a screenshot, or use it in your Godot Engine's game or project, you've come to the right place.

## How does it work?
There is a [WIKI](https://github.com/fenix-hub/godot-engine.easy-charts/wiki) with some tutorials, even if it is a work in progress.  
I'll make some videos as soon as possible.  

# Available Charts and when to use them    
This library offers a set of charts for each main Godot Node:   
- **Control Nodes:** "Control Charts" are fast Charts that can be plotted in a Control space, such as UIs or Control user interactable areas. They offer basic Control properties, such as Margins, size inheritance and control. No animations, no real time changes, just charts.   
- **2D Nodes:** "2D Charts" are a set of Charts which can be Used in 2D spaces. They offer additional tools, such as animations and real time changes in editor. They can be used to implement more aesthetic charts in 2D contexts.   
- **[wip] 3D Nodes:** "3D Charts" are a set of Charts which can be Used in both 2D and 3D spaces. They offer the possibility to plot 3D datasets, which are common in machine learning contexts or just data analysis. A Camera Control will also be available, which can be used to move around the chart.
